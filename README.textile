The CKFrog plugin adds the possibility to edit your Frog CMS pages with the WYSIWYG editor CKEditor.
Currently it is very simple and lacks support for using the CKFinder or viewing files on the server.
The images viewer and CKFinder are in the roadmap.

Released under GPL License.
The source code is available at github: "http://github.com/acrookston/ckfrog/tree":http://github.com/acrookston/ckfrog/tree

The CKEditor is released under various licenses (GPL among others) and may be downloaded on it's own from "http://ckeditor.com/":http://ckeditor.com/

*Enjoy!*
